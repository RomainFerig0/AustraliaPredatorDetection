# AustraliaPredatorDetection
This project aims to create a machine learning model able to identifty and differentiate various species of predatory Australian wildlife, including invasive species like foxes.

# Dataset
Data is taken from the UNSW Predators project and images are downloaded from the associated API. More information can be found [here](https://lila.science/datasets/unsw-predators/).

# Instructions
- Create a "data" folder, in the same directory as your code.
- Download the metadata .JSON containing the API links [here](https://lilawildlife.blob.core.windows.net/lila-wildlife/unsw-predators/unsw-predators.json.zip).
- Insert the .JSON file in the "data" directory. You're all set!
- Run the code step by step.

### Warnings:
- Download speed may vary depending on your internet speed and the chosen size of the dataset.
- Training speed may vary depending on parameters like epoch or resizing factor.
